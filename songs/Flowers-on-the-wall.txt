{title: Flowers on the wall}
{subtitle: Statler Brothers}

{start_of_verse}
1. [C]I keep hearin' you're concerned a[Am]bout my happiness
   But [D7]all that thought you've given me is [G7]conscience I guess
   If [C]I were walkin' in your shoes I [Am]wouldn't worry none
   While [D7]you and your friends are worryin’ bout me I'm [G7]havin' lots of fun
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: Countin' [Am]flowers on the wall that don't bother me at all
   Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty-one
   Smokin' [F]cigarettes and watchin’ Captain Kangaroo
   Now don't tell [G7]me [chunk] I've [F down]nothin' to [G7]do. [chunk]
{eoc}

2. Last night I dressed in tails pretended I was on the town
   As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
   So please don't give a thought to me I'm really doin' fine
   You can always find me here and havin' quite a time
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

3. It's good to see you I must go I know I look a fright
   Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
   And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
   So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

   Now don't tell [G7]me [chunk] I've [F down]nothin' to [G7]do [chunk]
   Don't tell [G7]me [chunk] I've [F down]nothin' to [G7]do
