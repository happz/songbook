2. I’m driving around in my car

   [Ami]Yesterday you told me ’bout the [Emi]blue blue sky
   And [F]all that I can [G]see is just a yellow le[C]mon-tree [G]
   I’m [C]turning my head [G]up and down
   I’m [Ami]turning turning turning turning [Emi]turning around
   And [F]all that I can [D]see is just another le[G]mon-tree

3. I’m sitting here, I miss the power

   While nothing ever happens and I wonder
