{title: King Herod's song}

{start_of_verse}
1. [Am]Jesus I am [C]overjoyed to [F]meet you face to [C]face
   [Am]You've been getting [C]quite a name [F]all around the [C]place.
   [Am]Healing [C]cripples [F]raising from the [C]dead
   [Am]And now I under[C]stand you're God at [F]least that's what you've [C]said...
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: So [C]you are the Christ you're the [D]great Jesus Christ
   [G]Prove to me that you've divine - [C]change my water  into  wine.
   That's [C]all you need do and I'll [D]know it's all true
   [G]Come on, [G7]King of the [C]Jews!
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
2. Jesus you just won't believe the hit you've made round here
   You are all we talk about the wonder of the year
   Oh what a pity if it's all a lie
   Still I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: So you are the Christ you're the great Jesus Christ
   Prove to me that you're no fool - walk across my swimming pool
   If you do that for me I'll let you go free
   Come on, King of the Jews!
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
3. I only ask things I'd ask any superstar
   What is it that you have got that puts you where you are?
   I'm waiting yes I'm a captive fan
   I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: So if you are the Christ yes the great Jesus Christ
   Feed my household with this bread, you can do it - on your head!
   Or has something gone wrong ?  Why do you take so long ?
   Come on, King of the Jews!
{eoc}

{comment: Outro, as chorus:}
   Hey! Aren't you [C]scared of me, Christ ?  Mr. [D]Wonderful Christ!
   [G]You're a joke, you're not the lord! [C]You are nothing but a fraud
   [C]Take him away - he's got [D]nothing to say
   [G]Get out you, [G7]King of the
   [G]Get out you, [G7]King of the
   Oh [G]Get out you, [G7]King of the [C]Jews!

   Get out of here
   Get out of here you
   Get out of my life!
