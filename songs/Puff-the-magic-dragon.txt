2. Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail,
   Jackie kept a lookout perched
   on Puff's gigantic tail.

   Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
   pirate ships would lower their flags
   when Puff roared out his name, oh.

3. A dragon lives forever but not so little boys,
   painted wings and giant's rings
   make way for other toys.

   One grey night it happened Jackie Paper came no more
   and Puff that mighty dragon he
   ceased his fearless roar.

4. His head was bent in sorrow green scales fell like rain
   Puff no longer went to play
   along the cherry lane.

   Without his lifelong friend Puff could not be brave
   so Puff that mighty dragon sadly
   slipped into his cave, oh.
