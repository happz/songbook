   [Ami] [G] [Ami] [G] [Ami] [G] [Ami] [G]

{start_of_verse}
1. I've seen the [Ami]yellow lights go [G]down the Missis[Ami]sippi [G]
   I've seen the [Ami]bridges of the [G]world and they are for [Ami]real [G]
   I've had [F]a red light off-the-[G]wrist without me [C]even getting [Ami]kissed
   It [F]still seems so [G]unreal
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
2. I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
   I've seen the sunset in the East and in the West
   I've sang the glory that was Rome and passed the 'Hound Dog' singer's home
   It still seems for the best
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: And I'm [C]far, [G]far a[Ami]way [Am7] with my [F]head up in the [G]clouds
   And I'm [C]far, [G]far a[Ami]way [Am7] with my [F]feet down in the [G]crowds
   Letting [C]loose a[G]round the [Ami]world [Am7] but the [F]call of home is [E7]loud
   Still as [Ami]loud
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
3. I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
   and felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land
   and though those Spanish nights were fine it wasn't only from the wine   
   It still seems all in hand.
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse}
4. I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on
   And though those aligator smiles stay in your memory for a while
   There still seems more to come
