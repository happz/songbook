{title: Ruby, don't take your love to town}

{start_of_verse}
1. [Tacet]You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted [G7]hair [Dm]
   [C]Ruby are you contemplating [F]going out some[G7]where?
   The [Dm]shadow on the wall tells me the [G7]sun is going down [Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: Oh [C]Ru[F]b[Am]y [Dm] Don't take your love to [C]town.
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
2. It [Dm]wasn't me who started that old [C]crazy Asian war
   But [Dm]I was proud to go and do my [F]patriotic [G7]chore.
   And [Dm]yes it's true that I'm not the [G7]man I used to be [Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: Oh [C]Ru[F]b[Am]y [Dm] I still need some compa[C]ny.
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
3. [C]It's hard to love a man whose legs are [F]bent and para[G7]lysed [Dm]
   and the [C]wants and the needs of a woman your age [F]Ruby I rea[G7]lize.
   But it [Dm] won't be long I've heard them say un[G7]til Iâ€™m not around [Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse}
4. [C]She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the [F]slamming of the [G7]door
   the [C]way I know I've heard it slam one [F]hundred times be[G7]fore.
   And if [Dm]I could move I'd get my gun and [G7]put her in the ground [Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: Oh [C]Ru[F]b[Am]y [Dm] Don't take your love to [C]town.
{eoc}

{soc}
R: Oh [C]Ru[F]b[Am]y [Dm] For god's sake turn around.
{eoc}
