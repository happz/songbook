{start_of_verse}
1. She's a [C]wonderful lady and she's [Am]mine, all mine
   and there [C]doesn't seem a way that she won't [Am]come and lose my mind
   It's too [F]easy hummin' [Dm]songs to a [F]girl in yellow [Dm]dress
   it's been a [C]long time since the party and the [Am]room is in a mess
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
2. The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor
   there are birds out on the sidewalk and a valet at the door
   he reminds me of a penguin, with few and plastered hair
   there's talcum powder on the letter, and the birthday boy is there
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: [Am]Why don't you cut your hair?!
   Why don't you live up there?!
   Why don't you do what I do, see what I feel when I care?!
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
3. Now they've darkened all the windows and the seats in naughahyde
   I've been waiting for an hour, I can't find a place to hide
   the being known as wonder girl is speaking I believe
   it's not easy trying to tell her that I shortly have to leave
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: Why don't you be like me?!
   Why don't you stop and see?!
   Why don't you hate who I hate, kill who I kill to be free?!
{eoc}
