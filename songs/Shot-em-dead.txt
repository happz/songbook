1. [G] Number [Em]One was a [C]young girl [D]dream
   [G] high [Em]school captain on the [C]football [D]team
   [G] and he was [Em]sweet, baby [C]sweet, he was [D]sweet on

   and I was making him my everything
   till I caught him in his car 
   with the homecoming queen

2. Number Two was a man of the law
   a million plaques hanging on his wall
   his name was Rob, drove a Saab
   was a know-it-all

   One day he took his little magnifying glass
   and started waving it all over my past
   he asked questions that he never
   should have asked

4. Number Four was a girl named Jane
   her hair was red and her face was plain 
   we read books and we cooked 
   and she kept me sane

   We were happy for the rest of our lives
   until the nursing home, age 99
   I stole her applesauce, 
   I thought that she gone blind
{end_of_verse}

   Nope. 

{soc}
R: She shot me dead 
   She shot me dead
   It was just bad luck
   She shot me dead
   Bang bang, bang bang
{eoc}
