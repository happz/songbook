2x [C] [G] [F] [G] [F] [C] [D] [G]

{start_of_verse}
1. [C]Think of you with [G]pipe and slippers, [F]think of her in [G]bed,
   [F]laying there just [C]watching telly then [D]think of me in[G]stead
   [C]I'll never grow so [G]old and flabby, [F]that could never [G]be
   [F]Don't marry [G]her, have [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
2. Your love light shines like cardboard but your work shoes are glistening
   She's a PHD in 'I told you so', you've a knighthood in 'I'm not listening'
   She'll grab your Sandra Bullocks and slowly raise the knee
   Don't marry her, have me
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
R: And the [C]Sunday sun shines down on San Fran[F]cisco [C]Bay
   And you [F]realise you can't make it any[C]way
   You [C]have to wash the car, take the [F]kiddies to the [C]park,
   [F]Don't marry [G]her, have [C]me
{eoc}

{start_of_verse}
3. Those lovely Sunday mornings with breakfast brought in bed
   Those blackbirds look like knitting needles trying to peck your head
   Those birds will peck your soul out and throw away the key
   Don't marry her, have me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
4. And the kitchen's always tidy and the bathroom's always clean
   She's a diploma in 'just hiding things', you've a first in 'low esteem'
   When your socks smell of angels, but your life smells of Brie
   Don't marry her, have me
{end_of_verse}
