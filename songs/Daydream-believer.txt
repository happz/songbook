{start_of_verse}
1. Oh, I could [G]hide 'neath the [Am]wings, of the [Bm]bluebird as she [C]sings
   The [G]six o'clock a[Em]larm would never [Am]ring [D7]
   But it [G]rings and I [Am]rise, wipe the [Bm]sleep out of my [C]eyes
   The [G]shavin' [Em]razor's [Am]cold, [D7]and it [G]stings [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{soc}
   [C]Cheer up, [D]sleepy [Bm]Jean, [C]oh what [D7]can it  [Em]mean,   [C]to a 
   [G]Daydream be[C]liever and a [G]home[Em]coming [A7]queen? [D7]

2. You once thought of me, as a white knight on his steed
   Now you know how happy I can be
   Oh, and our good times start and end,  without dollar one to spend
   But how much baby do we really need?
