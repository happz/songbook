1. Your [Am]beauty is be[C]yond compare
   With fla[G]ming locks of au[Am]burn hair
   With i[G]vory skin and [Em]eyes of emerald [Am]green
   Your [Am]smile is like a [C]breath of spring
   Your [G]voice is soft like su[Am]mmer rain
   And I can[G]not com[Em]pete with you, Jo[Am]lene

   There`s [G]nothing I can [Am]do to keep
   From [G]crying when he [Em]calls your name, Jo[Am]lene

   How [G]you could easily [Am]take my man
   But [G]you don`t know [Em]what he means to me, Jo[Am]lene

3. You [Am]could have your [C]choice of men
   But [G]I could never [Am]love again
   He`s [G]the only [Em]one for me, Jo[Am]lene

   My [G]happines de[Am]pends on you
   What[G]ever you de[Em]cide to do, Jo[Am]lene
